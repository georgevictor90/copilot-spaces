# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (facilitated by Project Manager or Scrum Master)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (Product Manager leads with input from UX Designer and QA Lead)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points with Developers)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) with input from QA Lead and team
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map
7. Review design requirements with UX Designer
8. Plan documentation needs with Technical Writer

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Facilitated by Scrum Master with participation from Product Manager, Developers, QA Lead, and UX Designer

- Confirm testing approach and design readiness with QA Lead and UX Designer

## Risk & Dependency Management

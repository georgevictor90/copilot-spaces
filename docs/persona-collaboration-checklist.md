## Escalation & Risk Management

### When to Escalate
- **Scrum Master**: Escalates team-level blockers that cannot be resolved within the team
- **QA Lead**: Escalates quality risks that threaten release timeline or product stability
- **UX Designer**: Escalates when user research reveals fundamental issues with product direction
- **Developers**: Escalate technical risks, architecture decisions, or significant delays
- **Technical Writer**: Escalates documentation gaps that impact user experience or compliance

### Escalation Path
1. Team-level discussion (Scrum Master facilitates)
2. Project Manager and Product Manager alignment
3. Product Lead or Engineering Lead (depending on nature of issue)
4. Executive Sponsor (for business-critical decisions)

### Shared Responsibilities
- **Risk Identification**: All roles contribute to identifying risks
- **Risk Ownership**: Project Manager maintains risk register, but mitigation is owned by relevant role
- **Communication**: Project Manager coordinates stakeholder updates, but all roles contribute status
- **Quality**: Everyone is responsible for quality, not just QA Lead
- **Documentation**: All roles ensure their work is documented, not just Technical Writer

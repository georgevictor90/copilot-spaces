# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome — this folder centralizes OctoAcme's project management processes and templates. The docs here give new and returning team members a single place to learn how projects are initiated, planned, executed, released, and improved. Use this README as your starting point and follow links to the detailed guidance for each process area.

OctoAcme runs projects through a lightweight, stage-gated lifecycle: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Continuous Improvement. Initiation captures the problem, success metrics, stakeholders, and a Project One-pager. Planning turns approved initiatives into prioritized backlogs, estimates, and release maps. Execution follows an iterative cadence with a project board and PR-driven development, while Release and Deployment guidance ensures safe rollouts, rollback plans, and post-deploy verification.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit: Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and stakeholder communications; Product Managers own outcomes, prioritization, and success criteria; Developers build and test solutions; Scrum Masters facilitate Agile ceremonies and remove blockers; UX Designers create user-centered designs; QA Leads define quality standards and coordinate testing; Technical Writers maintain documentation. These personas appear across our templates and checklists to make ownership and handoffs clear.

Communication and quality practices are disciplined and repeatable: regular standups and weekly delivery syncs, milestone demos, and monthly stakeholder reports. We use a single source of truth for status (the project README/release doc), standard templates for weekly/incident updates, and an escalation path for blockers. Quality is enforced through CI (unit/integration tests, linting, security scans), smoke tests in staging, and pre-release checklists documented in the release guide.
